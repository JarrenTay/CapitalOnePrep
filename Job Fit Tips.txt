Steps to take during the job fit interview.

1. Ask any clarification questions.
2. Think about an intuitive solution.
3. Say your intuitive solution.
4. Determine what steps are needed in your solution.
5. Say how you generally approach each of these steps in code. (I think I need to loop through...) (I'll need a vector to hold these values because...)
6. As you say your solution, write the code.
7. Think about some common edge cases. (Reach end of linked list)
8. Run through your code.

Always say what you're thinking out loud.
Be aware of what the interviewer is saying (probably a hint)
Look out for boundary errors. (for loop iteration count off by 1)
Practice these steps!
